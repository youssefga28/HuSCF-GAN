# Scenario guide:
# - Scenario 1 & 2: IID / non-IID Single-Domain
#     → Only ONE of the num_*_clients should be non-zero
#
# - Scenario 3, 4 & 5: IID / non-IID / Highly non-IID Two-Domain
#     → Exactly TWO of the num_*_clients should be non-zero
#
# - Scenario 6: IID Multi-Domain
#     → ALL num_*_clients should be non-zero (none should be zero)
